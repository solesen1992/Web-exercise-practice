@*
    This Razor view is part of an ASP.NET MVC application and is designed to display the details of a single customer. 
    The view is strongly typed to the Customer model (@model Exercise_MVCStarter.Models.Customer), meaning it receives 
    a Customer object from the controller and renders that data in the HTML output.

    // This section defines a Razor code block, currently empty.

    // Here, we are setting a value in the 'ViewData' dictionary to hold the title for the view.
    ViewData["Title"] = "Customer Details";
}

<!-- Outputs the title stored in 'ViewData["Title"]' within an <h2> HTML heading.
    This will display the text "Customer Details" as the page heading.-->

        <p>No customer found.</p>
